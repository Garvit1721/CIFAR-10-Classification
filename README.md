## Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for CIFAR-10 Classification

### Description

This script implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying images in the CIFAR-10 dataset. CIFAR-10 is a popular benchmark dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The goal is to train a CNN model to accurately classify these images into their respective categories.

### Data Loading and Preprocessing

The script loads the CIFAR-10 dataset using TensorFlow's `cifar10.load_data()` function. It then preprocesses the data by normalizing pixel values to the range [0, 1] and one-hot encoding the class labels.

### Model Architecture

The CNN model architecture consists of multiple convolutional layers followed by batch normalization, max pooling, and dropout layers to prevent overfitting. The final layers include fully connected (dense) layers with ReLU activation functions and a softmax output layer for classification.

### Training

The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function. Data augmentation techniques, such as width and height shifting, horizontal flipping, and rotation, are applied using the `ImageDataGenerator` class to increase the diversity of training samples and improve generalization. The model is trained using the augmented data with early stopping based on validation accuracy.

### Visualization

The script visualizes the training and validation accuracy and loss curves over epochs to monitor the model's performance and prevent overfitting.
